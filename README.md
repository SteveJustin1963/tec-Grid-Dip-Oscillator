tec1 controlled Grid dip oscillator

Yes, a grid-dip oscillator (GDO) can be controlled with software. A GDO is an electronic device that is used to measure the characteristics of an electrical signal. It can be used to measure the frequency, amplitude, phase, and other parameters of an electrical signal.and can be used to determine the impedance of an electrical circuit.and can also be used to determine the Q factor of an electrical circuit.and can be used to determine the bandwidth of an electrical circuit.  


the follwing is still in draft, contains errors


- F=frequency
- A=amplitude
- Z=impedance
- Q=Q-factor
- Tau=tau
- BW=bandwidth
- T=time period
- x=displacement of wave
- ω = angular frequency (rad/s), 
- P=ϕ=phase angle 

### F= 1 / T


### A= x / (sin (ωt + ϕ))


### Phase

This equation `P= -sin^(-1)(x/A) + 2 π n - t ω + π and A!=0 and x!=0 and n element Z` describes the position of a point on a circular path as a function of time. P is the position of the point, A is the radius of the circle, n is an arbitrary integer, t is time, and ω is the angular velocity of the point.

The first term, -sin^(-1)(x/A), describes the point's initial position on the circle. The point starts at x=0 and moves clockwise around the circle until it reaches x=A. At this point, the point has completed one full revolution and the angle between the point and the x-axis is -π radians.

The second term, 2 π n, represents the point's position after n full revolutions. For example, if n=1, then the point has completed two full revolutions and the angle between the point and the x-axis is -2π radians.

The third term, -t ω, represents the point's position at time t. The point's angular velocity is ω rad



### Z= 1 / (2 pi f C) 

### Q= 1 / (R C)


### Tau = RC = 1/(2 Pi Fc) ... r=resistance, C=Capacitance, Fc=freq cut off


### BW = 1 / (2 pi R C)
